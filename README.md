## ðŸ”§ Process & Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation in SQL
- Loaded raw sales datasets into a MySQL database.
- Performed data cleaning: handled NULLs, filtered irrelevant records, created joins across sales, customer, and product tables.
- Created views and summary tables for performance metrics like revenue, sales quantity, and profit margin.
- Extracted insights using SQL queries.

### 2. Power BI Dashboard Design
- Connected Power BI directly to the SQL database.
- Modeled relationships between tables and created calculated fields.
- Built interactive visuals:
  - **Bar charts** for market-level breakdowns
  - **Line graphs** for trend analysis
  - **Tables and KPIs** for customer-level metrics and key figures
- Incorporated slicers to allow dynamic filtering by time and geography.

### 3. Version Control & Documentation
- Uploaded all files and dashboard screenshots to GitHub for easy access.
- Documented the project with clear descriptions and visual previews.
